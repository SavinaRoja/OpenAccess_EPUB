<!--                    ADVANCED UNDERLINE AND OVERLINE ELEMENTS
                        (From the Elsevier DTD, used mostly within    
                        mathematics, when ordinary MathML underline   
                        and overline functions are inadequate. The
                        elements act as milestone tags marking the
                        start and end of over or underlining that
                        may extend across element boundaries.)     -->

<!--                    OVERLINE START                             -->
<!--                    The start of a milestone-created overline, the
                        end of ornament will be marked by an
                        Overline End element.
                        Remarks:
                        The <overline-start> and <overline-end> 
                        elements enable creation of overlines in 
                        content, most commonly in mathematical 
                        content, where an normal overline tag 
                        <overline> would break the XML 
                        well-formedness rule that no two elements
                        may overlap.  The overline created using
                        these two elements can have arbitrary start 
                        and end points because the start and end 
                        elements are paired through the use of the
                        unique IDs, not as the start and end of a 
                        single element.
                        For example, in the text "ABCD", if the text
                        "ABC" is the be overlined and the text "CD" 
                        is to be underlined, ordinary overlining with
                        <overline> would create invalid tag overlap. 
                        The text could be correctly tagged, using the 
                        Overline Start and Overline End elements
                        as:
                          <overline-start id="ovl4"/>AB
                          <underline-start id="ul1"/>C

                        Underline End element. 
                        Remarks: The <underline-start> and 
                        <underline-end> elements enable creation of 
                        underlines in content, most commonly in 
                        mathematical content, where an normal 
                        underline tag <underline> would break the
                        XML well-formedness rule that no two elements
                        may overlap.  The underline created using
                        these two elements can have arbitrary start 
                        and end points because the start and end 
                        elements are paired through the use of the
                        unique IDs, not as the start and end of a 
                        single element.
                        For example, in the text "ABCD", if the text
                        "ABC" is the be overlined and the text "CD" 
                        is to be underlined, ordinary overlining with
                        <overline> would create invalid tag overlap. 
                        The text could be correctly tagged, using the 
                        Overline Start and Overline End elements
