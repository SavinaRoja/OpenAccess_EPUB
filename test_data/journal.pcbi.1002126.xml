        <p>The acquisition and analysis of datasets including multi-level <italic>omics</italic> and physiology from non-model species, sampled from field populations, is a formidable challenge, which so far has prevented the application of systems biology approaches. If successful, these could contribute enormously to improving our understanding of how populations of living organisms adapt to environmental stressors relating to, for example, pollution and climate. Here we describe the first application of a network inference approach integrating transcriptional, metabolic and phenotypic information representative of wild populations of the European flounder fish, sampled at seven estuarine locations in northern Europe with different degrees and profiles of chemical contaminants. We identified network modules, whose activity was predictive of environmental exposure and represented a link between molecular and morphometric indices. These sub-networks represented both known and candidate novel adverse outcome pathways representative of several aspects of human liver pathophysiology such as liver hyperplasia, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. At the molecular level these pathways were linked to TNF alpha, TGF beta, PDGF, AGT and VEGF signalling. More generally, this pioneering study has important implications as it can be applied to model molecular mechanisms of compensatory adaptation to a wide range of scenarios in wild populations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Understanding how living organisms adapt to changes in their natural habitats is of paramount importance particularly in respect to environmental stressors, such as pollution or climate. Computational models integrating the multi-level molecular responses with organism physiology are likely to be indispensable tools to address this challenge. However, because of the difficulties in acquiring and integrating data from non-model species and because of the intrinsic complexity of field studies, such an approach has not yet been attempted. Here we describe the first example of a global network reconstruction linking transcriptional and metabolic responses to physiology in the flatfish, European flounder, a species currently used to monitor coastal waters around Northern Europe. The model we developed has revealed a remarkable similarity between network modules predictive of chemical exposure in the environment and pathways involved in relevant aspects of human pathophysiology. Generally, the approach we have pioneered has important implications as it can be applied to model molecular mechanisms of compensatory adaptation to a wide range of scenarios in wild populations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Modelling the responses and compensatory adaptations of living organisms to a changing environment is extremely important both in terms of scientific understanding and for its potential impact on global health. Although computational modelling of ecological systems has been utilised in ecotoxicology, the application of systems biology approaches to non-model organisms in general presents formidable difficulties, partly due to limited sequence information for environmentally relevant sentinel species. Moreover, the number of samples and the depth of information available are often limited and there may be a lack of truly relevant physiological endpoints. Thus, omics have proven effective in finding responses of aquatic organisms to model toxicants in laboratory-based experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-VanAggelen1">[1]</xref> but the environment poses a greater challenge as anthropogenic contaminants are present as complex mixtures and responses will additionally be dependent upon natural life history traits and other environmental factors.</p>
      <p>Relatively few omics studies have focussed upon the ecotoxicology of environmentally sampled fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Roling1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Larsen2">[7]</xref>. Although we have previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Williams1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Falciani1">[9]</xref> that expression of stress response genes could be used to distinguish fish from environmental sampling sites with different underlying contaminant burdens, this gave little insight to the health outcomes of these molecular differences. In this context, identifying molecular mechanisms of compensatory and toxic responses from observational data (reverse engineering), an approach that has been so successful in clinical studies and in laboratory model organisms, is highly challenging in field studies. We addressed this challenge by developing a novel network inference strategy based on the integration of multi-level measurements of populations of fish exposed to a diverse spectrum of environmental pollutants. This provides a useful model for a network biology approach generally applicable to non-model species and represents a breakthrough in the way we study the mechanisms whereby organisms respond to chemical exposure in the environment. We directed our efforts towards modelling molecular networks representative of populations of the flatfish European flounder (<italic>Platichthys flesus</italic>) sampled from marine environments of North Western Europe, including locations significantly impacted by anthropogenic chemical contaminants.</p>
      <p>The study integrated measurements representing a broad spectrum of samples characterized using transcriptomics, metabolomics, conventional biomarkers and analysis of chemicals in sediments from the sampling sites. Previous studies have shown both anthropogenic contamination and higher prevalence of pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions in flounder from the Elbe estuary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Koehler1">[10]</xref> and from the Mersey and Tyne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Stentiford1">[11]</xref>, together with elevated levels of hepatic DNA adducts at these sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Lyons1">[12]</xref>. Data integration was achieved by implementing a systems biology framework for network reconstruction, starting from cross-species mapping of sequence information to the integration of multi-level datasets within a framework for network inference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Basso1">[13]</xref> and culminating in the identification of network modules predictive of physiological responses to chemical exposure, valuable for marine monitoring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Lyons2">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The networks we identified demonstrate a remarkable parallel between human liver carcinogenesis and environmental effects on fish liver as well as revealing potentially novel adaptation mechanisms. The broader application of network biology approaches to other non-model species sampled from the environment is therefore likely to profoundly change our understanding of how living systems are likely to adapt to complex environments.</p>

        <title>The molecular state of flounder liver reflects chemical exposure</title>
        <p>An important assumption in many eco-toxicology studies is that the molecular states of organisms reflect their biological responses to complex chemical mixtures present within that environment. Indirect evidence suggests that this hypothesis may be correct. For example, consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Falciani1">[9]</xref>, we have identified genes and metabolites that were differentially expressed between environmental sites (the results obtained are shown in detail in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s008">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s004">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s005">S2</xref>). Many of these were either known to be associated with stress responses or were previously shown to respond to anthropogenic chemical contaminants in fish. Although these results were encouraging they did not provide a direct link between molecular status and response to specific chemicals. Since sediment chemistry data was available, we assessed whether chemical contaminant profiles could be inferred from gene expression data and whether these would at least partially match the known sediment composition. Our analysis was performed by linking genes differentially expressed between each sampling site and the reference site, with chemical-gene relationships within the Comparative Toxicology Database (CTD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Davis1">[15]</xref>. The Alde estuary was chosen as the reference site due to its low concentrations of major anthropogenic chemical contaminants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t001">Table 1</xref>), both in sediment and in flounder livers. These significant associations may be regarded as predictive of the most important classes of chemicals exerting their biological effects upon flounder gene expression amongst the highly complex chemical mixtures within the sediments at these sites. Results were consistent with the initial hypothesis, as where contaminants were highlighted both by chemistry and CTD analysis; sediment concentrations all exceeded the lower OSPAR ecotoxicological assessment criteria, except for PAHs at the Morecambe site. At Brunsbuttel, elevated chromium and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); at Cuxhaven, chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and PCBs; at Helgoland nickel, zinc, manganese and PCBs, at Mersey PCBs; at Morecambe Bay arsenic, nickel and PAHs; and at Tyne arsenic and PCBs were all predicted by the CTD analyses and confirmed by chemistry data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s006">Table S3</xref>). PAHs were predicted at Morecambe and Cuxhaven, with the AhR-inducer beta-naphthoflavone predicted at Brunsbuttel, Helgoland and Tyne, consistent with our finding of CYP1A transcriptional induction at all sites in comparison with the Alde. Additionally, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of all genes identified as significantly differentially expressed between sites showed significant associations with a number of toxicologically important processes and outcomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Laboratory exposures to individual chemicals mimic complex mixture responses in the environment</title>
        <p>We have previously shown that there is a strong link between laboratory exposure to individual chemicals and flounder hepatic gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Williams1">[8]</xref>. It was therefore reasonable to hypothesize that genes differentially expressed in laboratory exposures may map onto modules predictive of sampling location. Fisher's Exact Test was therefore used to identify modules where genes differentially regulated as a result of single chemical laboratory exposures were over-represented (these were determined by ANOVA FDR&lt;0.05 over 16 day time-courses post-intraperitoneal injection). Responses to lindane are shown as an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. This highlighted the temporal change in responses to toxicants, with the majority of overlapping modules occurring in both sub-networks A and B at early timepoints, followed by a shift towards sub-networks B and C at later timepoints. We have previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Williams1">[8]</xref> that this temporal change is associated with an early induction of transcripts for chaperones, phase I and II metabolic enzymes, oxidative stress and protein synthesis that diminishes by the later timepoints and is replaced by induction of protein degradation, immune-function and inflammation-related transcripts.</p>
        <p>The results for all treatments are illustrated graphically in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s002">Figure S2</xref> E to L. All treatments showed overlap with modules in group A, at the metabolite/transcript interface, and this was clearest for cadmium, that only affected this area, apart from one module in group C. All other treatments showed overlap between responsive genes and group B modules to varying extents and all except estradiol and cadmium overlapped with at least two modules within group C. These results are supported by our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Falciani1">[9]</xref> in which we found that employing transcripts altered during laboratory exposures to a range of individual toxicants improved predictivity of environmental sampling sites.</p>

        <title>Environmental exposure to polluted sites recapitulates human liver pathophysiology</title>
        <p>Having defined network modules predictive of geographical location, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to elucidate the detailed structure of molecular pathways and their potential association with specific signatures of liver pathology. We performed these analyses under the hypothesis that the underlying response to chemical exposure would be consistent with what is known of human liver molecular pathophysiology. It was therefore expected that significant associations between the modules defined by our analysis and networks stored in the Ingenuity database would be informative of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We indeed observed a remarkable overlap between modules predictive of geographical location and modules containing genes whose transcriptional profile has been previously associated with liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in mammals.</p>
        <p>Modules whose component genes related to hepatotoxicity are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g005">Figure 5</xref>. The major group of site-predictive modules shows significant overlap with modules relating to liver cholestasis and hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas the secondary group overlaps with liver fibrosis. The annotation gained from Ingenuity, with key regulators inferred from networks based on interaction information, was combined and clustered in the TMEV software package using 5 different algorithms. These show (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t004">Table 4</xref>) that genes and metabolites a) involved in bile acid synthesis, transport and amino acid metabolism b) predictive of parasite infection c) linked to hepatocellular carcinoma, reproductive disorders and liver cirrhosis d) responding to oxidative stressors <italic>tert</italic>-butylhydroperoxide (<italic>t</italic>BHP) and cadmium, the hormone estradiol and rodent peroxisome proliferator perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) are closely linked to differences between environmental sites. Additional relationships with inflammation, immune response, energy, fatty acids and nucleic acid metabolism, response to other toxicants and regulation by insulin, huntingtin, MYC and hepatocyte nuclear factor HNF4A were also highlighted. Functional analysis of the modules that were both site-predictive and associated with hepatocellular carcinoma showed significant overlap with mitochondrion, proteasome, tricarboxylic acid cycle, melanosome, protein dimerization activity, membrane-enclosed lumen, glutathione metabolism, coenzyme binding, microsome, translation, protein transport and carbohydrate catabolism (enrichment score &gt;2, FDR&lt;0.05).</p>

        <title>Knowledge-based analysis of predictive modules reveals potentially novel response pathways</title>
        <p>The models we have developed are a high level representation of the molecular network's underlying response to environmental exposure. In order to generate specific hypotheses on the molecular pathways modulated during compensatory adaptation and toxicity further in-depth analyses of the specific interactions between genes and metabolites were performed.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This is the first network level analysis of an environmental study integrating multilevel omic datasets. We discovered that the overall molecular state of the flounder liver (transcriptomics and metabolomics) is representative of the chemical contaminant burden of the sediments. Network reconstruction showed that the interface between transcriptional and metabolic network domains is linked to fish morphometric indices and is predictive of environmental exposure. In-depth analyses of predictive networks have identified putative novel pathways representative of responses to exposure. This approach provides a framework both for prediction of chemical pollutants in complex mixtures and for prediction of the health outcomes for exposed animals.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>The molecular state of flounder liver samples reflects chemical exposure</title>
        <p>The chemical exposures predicted from CTD interactions were partly confirmed by chemical data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t002">Table 2</xref>) despite the complexity of the environment, potentially including mixture effects, bioaccumulation and non-chemical stressors. Additional stressors were indicated that had not been chemically measured. Taking the Brunsbuttel site as an example, ethinyl-estradiol was a predicted contaminant and serum VTG protein, a canonical marker of endocrine disruption, was induced relative to the Alde (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t001">Table 1</xref>). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Pistocchi1">[16]</xref> and other persistent organic pollutants including PCBs, dieldrin and endosulfan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Kiersch1">[17]</xref> have been detected at elevated concentrations in the Elbe estuary and floodplain, and were all identified by our approach. Additional chemicals highlighted included systhane and vinclozolin fungicides, the halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon pesticide lindane, chlorine and tetradecanoylphorboyl acetate (TPA). It is uncertain whether these compounds are in fact present at this site as, for example, the presence of TPA appears unlikely. However TPA is a well-known tumour promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Blumberg1">[18]</xref>, so detection of its associated gene expression changes might be viewed as a biomarker of effect, not necessarily of a specific exposure. At a number of sites flavonoids and flavonols, such as epicatechin gallate, were predicted, potentially indicating plant-derived exposures not of anthropogenic origin. At Morecambe Bay and the Tyne the prediction of paraquat perhaps reflected an oxidative stress response rather than the presence of this particular compound.</p>
        <p>These results support the use of a knowledge-based approach to infer chemical exposure profiles from molecular responses and validate the underlying assumptions in the study. Predictions from interrogation of the CTD database (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s006">Table S3</xref>) differed between sites suggesting that the approach can be sufficiently sensitive to specific differences in the exposure profiles. However, we do not propose that these associations necessarily indicate the presence of each specific contaminant at each site, for example ‘tobacco smoke pollution’ in the Mersey, we instead hypothesise that these represent the effects of related stressors, for example, AhR inducers at the Mersey site.</p>

        <title>Interpretation of the molecular interaction network</title>
        <p>The development of a modular network, representing the integration between molecular and physiological readouts, provided us with an interpretive framework to analyse the complex molecular signatures linked to exposure. One of the most interesting findings is that the modules that predict environmental exposure with greatest accuracy represent the interface between metabolite and transcriptional networks and link to higher level indicators of fish health, such as condition factor and hepatosomatic index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Consistent with this observation, network modules at the interface between metabolite and transcriptional networks were also differentially regulated in response to single chemical laboratory exposures. It should be borne in mind that the environmentally sampled fish have been chronically exposed to pollutants, and that chronic exposure can result in different responses than acute exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Hook1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Leaver1">[20]</xref>. In addition bioavailability, mixture effects, metabolism and bioaccumulation affect compound-specific responses within the livers of these fish. This is illustrated by the modules containing genes that responded to 16-day treatments of flounder with individual toxicants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g004">Figure 4 B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s002">Figure S2</xref>). While all toxicants induced changes in the metabolic-interface genes, they also affected the secondary area of the network that related more to acute stress and immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g002">Figure 2</xref>, area B), in contrast to the differences between environmental sites, where only one module (40) in this area was affected.</p>
        <p>The characterisation of transcripts and metabolites that differed between sites was undertaken to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that they describe, and to inform on the potential health outcomes for the fish. Canonical pathways that contributed to these differences included those relevant to metabolism of toxicants; AhR signalling, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochromes P450, the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, glutathione metabolism and bile acid bioysnthesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t003">Table 3</xref>). Together these describe phase I and II metabolism of xenobiotics, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, and their excretion via the bile. Additional endobiotic metabolic pathways were affected. Changes in glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation implied disturbances to the energy pathways of the liver that could reflect the energetic requirements of xenobiotic metabolism and lead to further metabolic disruption. Changes in amino acid synthesis and proteasomal protein degradation also indicated reorganisation of metabolism.</p>
        <p>This change in metabolic state and gene expression could be viewed as a successful compensatory response to toxicants and thus of little concern for the health of individual fish and these fish populations. Further examination of the annotation of transcripts and metabolites differing between sites implied that this hypothesis was false. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g005">Figure 5</xref>, and shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t003">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t004">4</xref>, there is a remarkable overlap between site-predictive modules and modules associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, liver cholestasis -annotated modules overlapped with HCC and site predictive modules and this area of the network was highly associated with bile acid biosynthesis. Apart from this metabolic interface group only one other module (module 40) was predictive of site. This was also associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, and additionally with liver fibrosis, indicative of chronic liver damage, and occurred in an area of the network associated with inflammation. Therefore flounders inhabiting differentially contaminated sites show transcript and metabolite changes that have been associated with liver carcinogenesis in mammals. A question remains as to whether this simply represents the detection of HCC in the liver samples, as histopathology data were unavailable for the fish sampled off Germany. By comparison with studies of tumours from the closely related flatfish dab (<italic>Limanda limanda</italic>) this does not appear to be the case. In dab tumours the metabolites choline, phospocholine and glycine were reduced in concentration and lactate increased, an indication of the switch to anaerobic metabolism in the bulk tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Southam1">[21]</xref>. In, for example, the Brunsbuttel samples compared with non-tumour bearing Alde fish, choline, phosphocholine and glycine increased, and lactate decreased. Additionally, transcripts for ribosomal proteins showed co-ordinated induction in bulk tumours from dab, indicative of proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Small1">[22]</xref>, but no such induction was apparent from the present samples. The changes in gene expression and metabolites detected in this study do not recapitulate those found in bulk tumours, and may be viewed as indicating either an earlier stage of tumourigenesis or a permissive micro-environment in which hyperplastic tissue may form and lead to tumour formation.</p>

        <title>Network analysis reveals potentially novel response pathways</title>
        <p>Ingenuity networks, based on mammalian interaction data, permitted more detailed biological characterisation of the site-associated modules. Complete pathways were not recapitulated by these analyses, as only a minority of the transcripts and metabolites from flounder liver were examined. Nevertheless, the analyses highlighted important processes and inferred key regulators. Here the most significant network derived from site-predictive modules is discussed in detail and additional networks are discussed in terms of their key inferred regulators.</p>
        <p>The most striking finding from the Ingenuity analyses was the co-ordinated repression of proteasomal subunit genes at the Brunsbuttel site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s003">Figure S3A</xref>1). This was not so marked at other sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s001">Figure S1</xref>), indeed at Morecambe Bay these genes were induced in comparison with the Alde fish. Proteasome maturation protein (POMP) has been found to be a critical regulator of proteasomal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Fricke1">[23]</xref> and has been shown to be repressed by the halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) in an AhR-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Tijet1">[24]</xref>. Although TCDD concentration was not measured, the mean expression of proteasomal genes was inversely correlated (r = −0.79) with fish liver PCB concentrations but did not correlate well with sediment PAH or PCB concentrations. Tyne fish, for example, displayed relatively high proteasomal gene expression and had low liver PCB but high PAH concentrations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore the repression of proteasomal genes may represent a halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon-related response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In trout <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>, a proteasome inhibitor reduced PAH-dependent CYP1A induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Wiseman1">[25]</xref>, in contrast to mammalian studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-SantiagoJosefat1">[26]</xref>. This difference may contribute to the lower inducibility of CYP1A in flounder in comparison with many mammals. Ingenuity analysis also predicted an interaction between the proteasome and NF kappa B, a key regulator of mammalian hepatocarcinogensis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Sun1">[27]</xref>. The proteasome represses NK kappa B activation, and potentially disruption of proteasomal activity could have extensive additional effects on intracellular protein levels due to its role in the degradation of numerous proteins. We found no significant changes in NF kappa B gene expression between sites, and the consequences of putative activation at the Brunsbuttel site, and repression at the Morecambe site, due to changes in the proteasome, are difficult to predict, as in the early stages of carcinogenesis NF kappa B can have a protective effect, whereas in later stages it can promote tumourigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Sun1">[27]</xref>.</p>

        <p>From the Ingenuity networks a number of key regulatory molecules were inferred.

        <p>Insulin, in fish as in mammals, is a key hormonal regulator of energy, glucose and lipid metabolism, all pathways that were identified as affected by sampling site. By the Ingenuity networks it was linked to protein kinases, metabolites (including glucose and lactate) and the glucose transporter SLC2A4. The most obvious explanation for changes in insulin and related parameters would be differences in diet between fish from different sites. Amino-acid levels are more important regulators of insulin in carnivorous fish such as the flounder than sugars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Andoh1">[28]</xref>. Dietary parameters would be expected to be highly variable depending upon recent feeding history of the fish, which was unknown for these individuals. However, insulin can also be modulated by exposure to toxicants including organophosphates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Thangavel1">[29]</xref> that was suggested to lead to an increase in lipogenesis, in agreement with our observations of phospholipidosis in fish from polluted sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002126-t001">Table 1</xref>). Mild estrogenic endocrine disruption was suggested by VTG induction in Brunsbuttel fish, and networks shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s003">Figures S3A6 and S3A3</xref> inferred that estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), FSH and LH target genes were modulators of the different responses between sampling sites. ESR1 and HNF alpha were linked in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s003">Figure S3A</xref>6 and both are involved in hepatic cholestasis, indeed EE2-induced hepatotoxicity has been linked to alterations in bile acid biosynthesis in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Yamamoto1">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>PDGFBB is the dimeric form of platelet derived growth factor beta (PDGF-B). Notably, PDGF-B over-expressing mice spontaneously developed liver fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Maass1">[31]</xref>, and PDGF-BB was inferred as part of the network deriving from the liver fibrosis-annotated module 40 in our analysis. Additionally PDGF-B over-expressing mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma in response to phenobarbital and diethylnitrosamine treatment and induced TGF-beta and VEGF expression. TGF-beta was inferred to be an important regulator in site-specific responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s003">Figure S3A</xref>8) and is a well-known mediator of cancer initiation, progression and metastasis, via interaction with the inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Bierie1">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, an initiating signal for the innate immune response in fish as well as mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Yazawa1">[33]</xref>, was also identified by Ingenuity analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s003">Figure S3A</xref>5). Release of TNF alpha from Kupffer cells leads to hepatocyte cell death, regeneration and fibrosis that can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Farazi1">[34]</xref>. VEGF, best known as a stimulator of angiogenesis, was also highlighted in both the fibrosis-related and carcinoma-related sections of the network, and was linked with cell cycle, oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (CDKN1A, TP53, MYC). Angiogenesis is a key requirement for the transition from fibrosis to hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Fernandez1">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Angiotensinogen (AGT) is the precursor of angiotensin and was found to be repressed at all sites in comparison to the Alde reference site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s004">Table S1</xref>). Angiotensin is a signal for vasoconstriction in mammals and in fish its expression is related to osmoregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Larsen2">[7]</xref> with repression in liver in response to higher salinity. As the sampling sites differed in salinity, alteration of AGT transcription was not a surprising finding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, AGT was a member of the fibrosis-related module 40 and was predicted to form part of a complex network with VEGF, PDGF and intracellular kinases. Angiotensin has indeed been linked to stimulation of inflammatory liver fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Warner1">[36]</xref>, via fibroblast proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, including TGF-beta. Inhibition of the angiotensin system by antagonism of its receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Yoshiji1">[37]</xref> or inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Jonsson1">[38]</xref> has been shown to reduce hepatic fibrosis.</p>
        <p>VEGF, TGF beta, TNF alpha, PDGF and AGT are all intimately related to the progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in mammals. These molecules were all highlighted as important regulators of the differences between molecular profiles of flounder livers from different sampling sites using an unbiased approach combining network inference and predictive algorithms.</p>
        <p>A combination of omics, multiple biomarkers and bioinformatics were used to identify and characterise hepatic molecular changes between fish sampled from several environmental sites. Based on these data, parasite infection, fish morphology and genetics do contribute to the differences between sites, but do not explain the majority of changes seen. For example, within-site tests showed that morphometric parameters and parasite infections could be significantly associated only with a small proportion (&lt;3%) of the gene expression differences between sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s004">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s007">Table S4</xref>). Taken as a whole with our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Williams1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Falciani1">[9]</xref>, we find that anthropogenic chemical contamination of the marine environment is a major factor in explaining the molecular differences between fish sampled from these sites.</p>
        <p>The different methodologies employed displayed different strengths and weaknesses. Histopathology was a good guide to broad levels of pollution effect, but provided little information upon the nature of the contaminant profile. Protein biomarkers and enzyme activities were useful for categorising sites by major classes of toxicant, but gave little information on the potential health outcomes. <sup>1</sup>H NMR metabolomics showed low technical variability, and metabolite profiles alone were more predictive of sampling site than gene expression profiles alone, however the annotation of metabolites is not yet well advanced, limiting the functional information currently available. Transcriptomics exhibited higher variability than metabolomics, but was more informative due to better annotation. Overall the methodologies were highly complementary, allowing analyses that would be impossible if one were limited to a single technique.</p>
        <p>The gene expression signatures associated with fish from each sampling site were used to predict the presence of chemical contaminants using the CTD gene expression-chemical interaction database. Mixture effects, other environmental influences and the similarity of certain stressors, such as the metals, might be expected to confound this approach. Additionally the incomplete nature of the flounder microarray and the CTD database and the limited numbers of samples for certain sites, which is a common issue in field studies, reduce the potential of this analysis. Therefore we did not expect to predict all environmental contaminants by this method. While this approach was useful with the current dataset, it may be expected to improve in future as both the CTD database and transcriptomic data become more comprehensive.</p>
        <p>Data integration and network analyses were essential; both to predicting health outcomes and to identifying and examining affected biological pathways. They allowed visualisation of the highly complex dataset and facilitated comparison of the effects of different stimuli upon the model system. Modules associated with specific parameters could then be examined in detail, utilising interaction databases (Ingenuity) for further characterisation. Detailed examination of these networks illustrated the changes detected by broader classification of modules by annotation terms. In addition to potential interactions with diet and salinity, the majority of networks contained key regulators of inflammation, hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore we propose that network biology approaches can lead to the identification of health impacts of environmental pollutants upon non-model organisms.</p>
        <p>The molecular differences between reference and contaminated sampling sites were associated with carcinogenesis, and this outcome is supported by previous histopathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Koehler1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Stentiford2">[39]</xref>. Flatfish hepatic histopathology has long been associated with chemical contamination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Stentiford2">[39]</xref> and our results demonstrate the linkages between toxicants and histopathology via alterations in molecular signalling pathways and metabolism.</p>

Adult European flounders (<italic>Platichthys flesus</italic>) were caught during statutory monitoring programs carried out by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) at UK sites in April 2006 and by AWI Bremerhaven at FRG sites in October 2004 and April 2005. Fish were caught using beam trawls and held in tanks of flowing sea water onboard ship and were dissected either onboard ship or on return to shore. Livers were immediately removed and 100 mg samples for microarrays and metabolomics and 200 mg samples for biomarker assays were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, with liver slices taken for histopathology. Blood was extracted and stored at 4°C overnight before plasma preparation for vitellogenin (VTG) analysis. Fin clips (1 cm<sup>2</sup>) were preserved in 70% ethanol at 4°C for genotyping. After sexing, livers from males that were 12 to 34 cm long were used for further analyses, this sample set included n = 20 for Alde, n = 16 for Tyne, n = 22 for Mersey, n = 23 for Morecambe Bay, n = 22 for Helgoland, n = 24 for Cuxhaven and n = 48 for Brunsbuttel. Fish lengths and weight, condition factor (K; body wt/length<sup>3</sup>×100), liver weight and hepatosomatic index (HSI; liver wt/body wt×100) were determined for all samples, gonad weight and gonadosomatic index (GSI; gonad wt/body wt×100) for FRG fish only.</p>

UK data was analysed from that collected as part of the Clean Safe Seas Environmental Monitoring Programme (CSEMP) and archived in the UK's Marine Environment Monitoring and Assessment National database (MERMAN). For sediment; metal concentrations (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn); polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (anthracene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[ghi]perylene, chrysene/triphenylene, fluoroanthrene, indo[123-c]pyrene, naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene); total organic carbon and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (congeners CB28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) were determined and the sum of PAHs and the sum of ICES 7 priority PCBs calculated for all sites. For flounder livers; metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn) and PAHs (acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, benzo[a]anthracene, C1-, C2- and C3- naphthalene, C1-phenanthrene/anthracene, chrysene, fluoroanthrene, fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene and sum of PAHs) were determined for Alde, Tyne and Mersey fish, with partial metal concentration data for Morecambe Bay, Helgoland, Cuxhaven and Brunsbuttel samples.

Data were log2 transformed, quantile normalised and de-noised by a) removing data where SD/mean was more than 0.9 and b) removing data where maximum–minimum was less than 1.5. Missing data were estimated using MetaGeneAlyse probabilistic principal components analysis (PCA) algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Daub1">[54]</xref>.

A representative clone with greatest average expression across all samples was chosen for each contiguous sequence cluster where the Pearson correlation score was greater than 0.6 to other members of the cluster. Where the correlation failed to pass this cut-off, data were discarded. The noise level for each metabolomics NMR spectrum was estimated by dividing the spectrum into 32 regions and calculating the smallest bin SD for each region and multiplying this by 3. These results were used to de-noise the data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Golotvin1">[56]</xref>.

An additional dataset was generated for the omics samples that also possessed genetic data.</p>
        <p>Normalised combined microarray and metabolomic data were input to Genespring GX 7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Statistically significantly changing genes were found by 1-way ANOVA with a multiple testing correction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Benjamini1">[57]</xref> for a false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;0.05, and with Welch T-tests employing the same FDR. Fold change cutoffs of 1.5-fold were additionally applied. A classification algorithm was used to compare previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Falciani1">[9]</xref> with the current data; this employed the Support Vector Machines algorithm within Genespring with the Kernel Function Polynomial Dot Product (Order 3), a Diagonal Scaling Factor of 0, for all genes passing QC cut-offs in both experiments.

Lists of genes and metabolites were additionally interrogated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity IPA 8.5; Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA), employing Human Gene Organisation (HUGO) gene identifiers and PubChem CID compound identifiers, with statistical tests using Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing corrections.</p>
        <p>The overall approach taken for network construction and analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002126-g001">Figure 1</xref>. It is conceptually sub-divided into: 1) Selection of network hubs: 2) Construction of a fully connected network: 3) Identification of network modules representing the neighbourhood of the hubs: 4) Assembly of the final modules and graphical representation: 5) In-depth analysis of gene interactions using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software.</p>
        <p>The network was constructed from all measured variables, including transcript, metabolite, morphometric, protein biomarker and genetic data. Within the network each individual variable is described as a node. We selected 99 ‘hub’ nodes representing transcripts with known toxicological and regulatory relevance in order to identify the molecular network representing the interactions between these hubs and all the other nodes in the multi-level dataset. In addition, morphometric indices and metabolite peaks were also included in the list of hubs to represent the complexity of the metabolic networks, which, we reasoned are likely to closely influence liver physiology. The network inference methodology ARACNE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Basso1">[13]</xref> was used to create the network. Statistically significant interactions were selected on the basis of mutual information between the nodes at cut-off of P&lt;1e-6. We defined 99 modules derived from each selected hub and its neighbourhood. Many nodes were present in multiple modules. The overlap index was calculated between each pair of modules by dividing the number of overlapping nodes by the total number of nodes in the smaller module. The final network was then constructed as the union of all network modules and visualized using a force driven layout available in the software application Cytoscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Shannon1">[63]</xref>. In the final network, the edge distances between the modules are relative to the overlap index and the node sizes are relative to the size of the module. We also compared this strategy to develop mutual information-based modules from hub variables with a more complex method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Abraham1">[64]</xref>, shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002126.s008">Text S1</xref>, and discovered that they both gave similar results.</p>
        <p>Subsequently the multivariate selection algorithm GALGO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Trevino1">[65]</xref> was applied to each module to determine its predictivity for parameters including fish sampling site, parasite infection, and the presence or absence of liver pathologies. The cut-off employed for identification of predictive modules was &gt;70% specificity and &gt;70% sensitivity. Genes were annotated with HUGO identifiers for their putative human orthologs. DAVID v 2008 and v6.7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Dennis1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Huangda1">[67]</xref> was used to classify module genes and groups of modules inferred from the topology of the module graph, by their shared Gene Ontology (GO) and other annotation terms. Flounder laboratory treatment data was employed to relate gene expression changes seen in the environmental samples to those elicited by model toxicant treatments. These treatments consisted of a single intraperitoneal injection with cadmium chloride (Cd, 50 µg/kg), 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC, 25 mg/kg), aroclor 1254 (50 mg/kg), <italic>tert</italic>-butyl-hydroperoxide (<italic>t</italic>BHP, 5 mg/kg), lindane (25 mg/kg), perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, 100 mg/kg), estradiol (l0 mg/kg) and furunculosis vaccine (killed <italic>Aeromonas salmonicia</italic>, Aquavac Furovac 5; 1 ml/kg) with gene expression monitored over a 16-day timecourse versus appropriate controls. Full details are shown in Williams <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Williams3">[48]</xref>, Williams <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Williams1">[8]</xref> and Diab <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Diab1">[49]</xref>, with data available from ArrayExpress under accessions E-MAXD-32 and E-MAXD-38. Overlap between module genes and genes differentially expressed by toxicant treatments over the 16 day timecourse, ANOVA, FDR&lt;0.05 was determined by Fisher's Exact Test with a cut-off of P&lt;0.01. Modules and groups of modules were interrogated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Key regulatory molecules were inferred from networks generated within Ingenuity, that also output functional enrichment within the lists of nodes (P&lt;0.05). Modules were annotated with associated diseases, functions, canonical pathways, toxicity and hepatotoxicity terms within Ingenuity and with inferred key regulators, as well as with environmental and parasitological predictivity and overlap with laboratory treatment data to produce a binary matrix. This was clustered within TMEV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002126-Saeed1">[62]</xref> using hierarchical clustering, SOTA self organising tree, K-means, QT and SOM self organising map algorithms. Grouped modules that were predictive of sampling site were subjected to Ingenuity analyses and were overlaid with Brunsbuttel expression data relative to Alde, the reference site. These genes and metabolites were subjected to K-means clustering within TMEV and the clusters functionally annotated using DAVID.</p>
